# CBLWEEK3

## This week's homework is about working with 3 files. We have two input and one output file.

* SORTEG02 Creates a QSAM file with user information.
* DELDEF01 Uses the previously created QSAM file to create a VSAM file(Basically a QSAM file with keys for random or sequential data access)
* SORTEG03 Creates another QSAM file that includes keys with which we can read from the VSAM file.
* Finally we can read the key from the input file, read the entry in the VSAM file with the given key, and output the entry to another QSAM file.
